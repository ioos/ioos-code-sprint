To what extent will constraining sea-ice-cloud feedbacks reduce uncertainty in
our understanding of Arctic amplification and global climate sensitivity? Both
observations and modelling studies have evidenced the importance of polar clouds
(and aerosol) in controlling the surface energy budget at high-latitudes.
High-latitude clouds are highly sensitive to changes in aerosol concentration
and strongly coupled to sea-ice processes. Thus, our expectation is that
high-latitude clouds will fundamentally change in a warming world with the
potential to both mitigate or enhance warming at high-latitudes. However, both
high-latitude cloud and aerosol have (historically) been poorly simulated in
global climate models and across CMIP6 we predict significant variation in model
outcomes with respect to high-latitude cloud forcings. In this project we will
quantify the importance of sea-ice cloud feedbacks across CMIP6 ensembles and
estimate the impact of constraining this feedback on our understanding of Arctic
amplification and global climate sensitivity.
