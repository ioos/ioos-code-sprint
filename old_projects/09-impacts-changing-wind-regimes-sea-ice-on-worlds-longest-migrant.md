Arctic terns are one of very few species in the world to spend considerable
parts of time every year at both poles, migrating at least 90,000 km per year
between the two (1, 2), which is the longest recorded migration of any animal.
They are particularly vulnerable to climate change, with a short window to breed
in their arctic range during the boreal summer, their reliance on tailwinds to
support both their south- and north- bound migrations (3), and their use of sea
ice to forage in the Southern Ocean during the austral summer. Using tracking
data (from breeding arctic terns caught in Greenland (1) and Sweden (4)), and
Iceland,  we are interested in investigating how predicted changes over the next
100 years will impact the winds that migrating arctic terns rely on, and how the
changing ice edge will affect their foraging during the non-breeding period.
