# Introduction to organising team

---

# Project lead expectations

* Time commitment

* We recommend that during your first breakout group session, you  
  **nominate a group chair** for your project (this person **need not be you**)

  Responsible for:
  * Keeping group to time
  * Getting group ready to present
  * Ensuring code/outputs are well organised
  * etc.

  Excellent way for an ECR to gain team management experience

# Accounts & communication

### Communication

* **Zoom** for talks and breakout groups
* **Slack** for text-based chat
* **Word Online** shared documents

### Storing code, data and outputs

* **GitHub repository**
* Directory in the hackathon's **Group Workspace** 

???

We will use one Zoom call for the duration of the event, and you will be able to
move between rooms as you need.

We have a Slack channel for each project group, plus another channel for support
from our team of data scientists.

---

# Using JASMIN & notebooks

* **Own account** or temporary account
* **Drop-in sessions** in case of issues

Follow [our online guide](https://cmip6moap.github.io/resources/creating-jasmin-account)
to ensure you have correct permissions and can log in

### We anticipate

* **Notebook Service** for most tasks – e.g. data visualisation and writing a
  narrative to accompany any analysis ([example](https://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/cossatot/lanf_earthquake_likelihood/blob/master/notebooks/lanf_manuscript_notebook.ipynb))

But also:

* **Scientific analysis servers** to run scripts from the command line (using
  SSH) or push/pull changes to/from GitHub
* **LOTUS job system** to execute batch jobs for long-running jobs processing
  large amounts of data (this may have been done in advance of the hackathon)

???

Expect all project leads to have own account.

If you don't already have an account then we will allocate you a temporary
account that you can use for the duration of the hackathon. Bear in mind that
all data in temporary accounts will be removed at the end of the hackathon, so
you must have saved your data elsewhere.

For those of you unfamiliar with Notebooks, we suggest you take a look at some
example notebooks linked to on our website. In essence, Notebooks are an
interactive computing environment allowing you to combine narrative text
(written in Markdown) with code and the output of that code.

This means they can be made into a complete and self-contained record of a
computation. They are **well-suited to data visualisation and teaching**. Some
good examples linked to on website.

Notes:

* When using the JASMIN Notebook Service, you only have read-only access to
  Group Workspaces, however when logged in via SSH you will have full read/write
  access

* While all the Scientific analysis servers will allow you to communicate with
  GitHub using HTTPS, if you wish to use SSH then you will need to use `sci1`,
  `sci2`, `sci4` or `sci5`

* We have 3 TB of GWS space available for *all* hackathons

# By the end of the hackathon

1. **README** in GitHub repository file

2. Identify **key figures** that could be showcased at COP26

3. **Code**, **notebooks** & other outputs (**figures**, **graphs**, etc.)
   committed to GitHub

4. **Data** outputs in Group Workspace

???

GitHub README to identify what work you did, how far you got and what the next
steps required are.

Data outputs can go on GitHub if small enough.

Potentially every member of your team will make contributions to the GitHub
repository, or perhaps you will allocate a member of your team who will be
responsible for committing everyone's work (see also: group chair).

# Support during the event

Team of data scientists from the University of Bristol's Jean Golding Institute
and climate researchers from Bristol & Exeter

* Hackathon organisation questions
* Using JASMIN
* Using Jupyter Notebooks
* Python technical queries, e.g. pandas, matplotlib, xarray, etc.
* Best practices for reproducibility
* Best practices in data visualisation

### Contact via

* **#help channel** on Slack
* Email to cmip6moap-hackathonevent2021@bristol.ac.uk

???

Also have a dedicated help breakout room on Zoom you to in case we need to talk
about your question or share screens.
