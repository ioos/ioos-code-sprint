The IOOS Code Sprint is a 4-day hackathon style event on **21-23 May 2024**, organized by the Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System (MARACOOS) and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) Office. Over the course of the event, teams of developers, academic researchers, and community members will work on projects that address pressing data and information challenges.
