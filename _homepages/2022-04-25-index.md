The IOOS Code Sprint is a 4-day hackathon style event on **25-28 April 2022**, organized by the Great Lakes Observing System (GLOS) and the Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) Office. Over the course of the event, teams of developers, academic researchers, and community members will work on projects that address pressing data and information challenges. Projects will relate to the IOOS mission to produce, integrate, and communicate high quality ocean, coastal and Great Lakes information that meets the safety, economic, and stewardship needs of the Nation.

To register for the event please see the [registration page]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/registration). Participation is open to the IOOS community. The closing date for registration is **31 March 2022**.

Researchers will sign up to work on [topics ranging from]({{ site.baseurl }}/2022/topics) ERDDAP, General Python, Biology/Ecology, Cloud, IoT, Metadata, and more. Teams will be lead by individuals who have a keen interest in specific topics. Some of the already identified topics include:
* Using ERDDAP in the IOOS RA/DAC archive pipelines.
* User documentation on "how to get started with your erddap server"
* IOOS Compliance Checker refactor and documentation/examples for plugins
* OBIStools-style QC library in Python

If you have topics of interest, see the [track list](https://github.com/ioos/ioos-code-sprint/blob/main/2022/track-list.md) page for contribution guidance.

The event will take place virtually and in-person, using a combination of **video conferencing** (TBD) for meetings and seminars, and **discussion forums** ([Slack invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/ioos/shared_invite/zt-14r0ntixu-7ux490FNRRvXCNJ0Kz~nKg) - see `#code-sprint-2022` channel) for ongoing communication. Outputs will saved to [GitHub]({{ site.github.owner_url }}).
