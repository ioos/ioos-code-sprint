Refactor and possibly change the calling conventions of compliance checker. Make documentation for development of new plugins much easier. Possibly address OceanGliders 1.0 standard, others as needed.

**Expected Outcomes:**

Improved documentation for Compliance Checker, improved calling conventions, adaptation of plugins to specific metadata standards such as OG 1.0

**Skills required:**

Python programming, basic understanding of NetCDF files and associated metadata standards (CF, ACDD, etc).

**Difficulty:**

Moderate
